# Auction Algorithm

This is a C++ implementation of Bertsekas's Auction Algorithm. The code generates a random cost matrix and then solves the problem of optimaly assigning N objects to N people given the preferences specified in the cost matrix.

 On my machine the code could solve a size 500 assignment problem in ~.2 seconds.
